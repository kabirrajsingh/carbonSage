{    "optimized_code": "  \n        The given code snippet is not optimized for CPU, memory, or readability. Here's an optimized version of the code:\n\n        ```\n        def power_bound():\n    print(\"Starting power bound task\")\n    x = 2**1000000\n    print(\"Exiting power bound task\")\n    return x\n        ```\n\n        The optimized code is more efficient in terms of CPU and memory usage. It also improves readability by using a more concise and efficient way of calculating the power.\n\n        The time complexity of the optimized code is O(1) as it only performs a single operation, which is the power calculation. The space complexity is also O(1) as it only uses a single variable to store the result.\n\n        Overall, the optimized code is more efficient and easier to read than the original code."
